## Notes

This project was initialy made in august 2025 but polished and finished in november 2025.
It was made to get more familiar with Vue components, recursivity, and design.

Of course if I had to make a similar project today, I'd probably do things a bit differently. Most notably about the taskStore. It handles objects that follows the same structure, yet doesn't create these objects using a class. A baffling choice. Maybe I'll polish this too when I have the time.

However in the meantime it works.
